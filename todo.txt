Project Outline:

Phase 1: 
--- Set up the Data
--- Collect and organize data.
--- Download and parse data.
--- Store data in a local ???? will think about it -> SQLite/MySQL database.

==== COMPLETE THIS FIRST
Phase 2: Basic Search Functionality
--- Implement linear and binary search.
--- Test the performance on your datasets.

==== FAR AWAY RIGHT NOW
Phase 3: Advanced Search Algorithms
--- Implement Trie (Start cp plzzz) 
--- Inverted Index + TF-IDF
--- BM25 
--- B-tree indexing

---- Add a ranking mechanism to improve search relevance.
??? dubious still need to think about it

===== Later
Phase 4: Benchmarking and Optimization
---- Test all algorithms and compare performance.
---- Fine-tuning the algorithm based on dataset size and user needs.
